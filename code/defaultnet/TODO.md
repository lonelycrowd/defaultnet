1) Models

- [x] To write base model
- [x] To write sketch of the model

2) Network

- [x] Base layers
- [x] Some general stage blocks (parts of yolov3)
- [x] default head (yolo)
- [x] default backbone (yolo)

3) Machine

- [x] Make base
- [x] Make general training tool
- [ ] Make general testing tool

4) Losses

- [x] To realize some standard losses like for SSD or YOLO (yolo, not good)
- [ ] Some base loss with different modules appliable (focalloss, switch between binary crossentropy and softmax...).

5) Data

- [x] Add some fundamental stuff
- [x] Skeleton of custom datasets
- [ ] Transforms
